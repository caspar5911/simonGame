            <p>1. At the start, Simon's game will randomly give you a signal ( one color will pop up). <br>2. You have to repeat the signal by pressing the same color. <br>3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add a random one. <br>4. You need to
                repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in the order. <br>5. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one. <br>6. You need to repeat these three signals in the order. <br>7. Simon will repeat all three signals
                and add one. <br>8. Continue playing as long as you can repeat the sequence. <br>9. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon will automatically speed up. That means you need to add Skill levels. <br>10. If you fail to repeat
                a sequence exactly, or if you take more then 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "REZZ" sound. That means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. GAME OVER. <br>11. If you manage to repeat of sequences for skill
                levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 and Simon will salute you with six short signals from the last lens you pressed. </p>
